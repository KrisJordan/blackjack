# CLI Blackjack

## Features

- Multiple players
- Splitting
- Doubling down
- Variable # of decks
- Variable # of starting chips
- Quitting and resuming play by replaying an append-only write-ahead log

## Playing

### Requirements

- Ruby 1.9+
- Bundler

### Install & Play

1. `git clone git@github.com:KrisJordan/blackjack.git`
1. `cd blackjack`
1. `bundle install`
1. `./blackjack`

### Run rspec tests

`bundle exec rspec`

### Command-line Options

`./blackjack --help` to print command line options.

`./blackjack --players=1 --decks=2 --chips=100`

* `players` sets # of players in the game.
* `decks` sets # of decks in each round.
* `chips` sets # of chips each player starts with.

`./blackjack --verbose` resume a game and print all events resumed.

### "Pausing" a Game

Break out of / pause a game at any point by interrupting
with `Ctrl+C`.

### Resuming Game

To resume a game, rerun `./blackjack` in the same directory
and press `y`, or run with the `--verbose` flag.

## Organizational Notes

The architecture of this project began with a few first principles,
largely as an exercise to try them in a Ruby codebase:

 - **Immutability** - All objects, with the exception of the top-level
 `Game` object, are immutable. All write accessors are copy-on-write.

 - **Event-driven** - When state needs to change, an `Event` is emitted
 to the `Game`. The game then handles the `Event` by executing its `#transform`
 method. The `Event#transform` method accepts a `Round` and returns a new,
 transformed `Round` as effected by the `Event`. In essence:
 `Event#transform(Round) -> Round'`

 - **Write-ahead log** - A nice side-effect of an event-driven
 architecture is that events can be logged to an append-only file and easily
 replayed to return a game to any state. The write-ahead log for this game
 is stored in your current working directory under `.blackjack.aof`. Its format
 is a simple, JSON serialization, whose first serializes the top-level
 of a `Game` and subsequent lines are `Event` objects transforming the game's
 state.

## Codewalk, Top-down

* Primatives
 * card.rb - the atom
 * hand.rb - contains both cards in hand and chips riding on hand
 * deck.rb - a stack of cards
 * player.rb - a named holder of chips
 * dealer.rb - a cold body
* High-level flow
 * bin/blackjack.rb - command-line parser/runner
 * game.rb - where mutable state of current players and round is kept, event loop runs here
 * round.rb - immutable representation of a round at a point in time. Setters are copy-on-write.
 * turn_iterator.rb - simple cursor for traversing the states, players, and hands of a round
 * game_journal - the write-ahead logger/replayer
* Round States in `state/`
 * betting.rb - players buy into the round
 * dealing.rb - players receive a random card one at a time, run twice
 * playing.rb - players move through each of their hand(s) until busting or passing
 * paying.rb - players beating or pushing with the dealer are distributed chips
 * ending.rb - round is over
* Events in `event/`
 * base.rb - event base class with descriptions of methods
 * bet.rb - player placed a bet
 * skip.rb - noop skip turn (i.e. dealer's turn to bet)
 * stand.rb - player ends turn
 * hit.rb - be dealt another card, do not advance turn
 * bust.rb - emitted when hand value exceeds 21
 * double_down.rb - double bet on hand and receive 3rd, final card
 * split.rb - split hand and put in more chips on second hand. Dealt a new card per hand.
 * win.rb - reason and # of chips won by player event
 * lose.rb - noop for printing narration
 * end.rb - round is over
