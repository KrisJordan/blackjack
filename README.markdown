## Organizational Notes

The architecture of this project began with a few first principles,
largely as an exercise to try them in a Ruby codebase:

 - **Immutability** - All objects, with the exception of the top-level
 `Game` object, are immutable. All write accessors are copy-on-write.

 - **Event-driven** - When state needs to change, an `Event` is emitted
 to the `Game`. The game then handles the `Event` by executing its `#transform`
 method. The `Event#transform` method accepts a `Round` and returns a new,
 transformed `Round` as effected by the `Event`. In essence:
 `Event#transform(Round) -> Round'`

 - **Write-ahead log** - A nice side-effect of an event-driven
 architecture is that events can be logged to an append-only file and easily
 replayed to return a game to any state. The write-ahead log for this game
 is stored in your current working directory under `.blackjack.aof`. Its format
 is a simple, JSON serialization, whose first serializes the top-level
 of a `Game` and subsequent lines are `Event` objects transforming the game's
 state.
